# The Underground Engine

First pass at making my own 3D game engine, taking heavy inspiration from the Unity Engine.
Was originally going to be purpose built for a game I'm working on (called "The Underground"), but it soon
became useful for making any sort of 3D application.

Currently the engine is a C++ library that must be linked and included into an existing project,
however I plan for it to also be usable as a GUI application in the future.

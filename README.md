# The-Underground

A first attempt for a 3D game engine

# Current Plans

The plan at the minute is to get this working as a nice portable library, complete with docs and everything.

# TODO

[1] Main priority is making the engine library simple to incorporate into a project
[2] Move glClearColor and buffer clearing somewhere more appropriate, end user should not make glCalls
